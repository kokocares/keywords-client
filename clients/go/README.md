Koko Keyword Python Client
============

A go client  for the [Koko Keywords API](https://developers.kokocares.org). The client handles caching to ensure very low latency.


## Install

### Install dynamic library

First identify which platform you need to install. Our client currently supports
OSX and Linux across x86_64 and Arm64 architectures. An easy way to do this is
using `uname`:

```
uname -a
```

Download the correct library for your platform:
- [OSX,
  x86_64](https://github.com/kokocares/keywords-client/raw/main/clients/clib/libkoko_keywords_x86_64.dylib)
- [OSX,
  ARM64](https://github.com/kokocares/keywords-client/raw/main/clients/clib/libkoko_keywords_arm64.dylib)
- [Linux,
  x86_64](https://github.com/kokocares/keywords-client/raw/main/clients/clib/libkoko_keywords_x86_64.dylib)
- [Linux,
  ARM64](https://github.com/kokocares/keywords-client/raw/main/clients/clib/libkoko_keywords_arm64.dylib)

Move the file to your shared library directory and rename the library removing
the os/architecture label and make sure the file has execution prviledges:

On OSX
```
mv libkoko_keywords_x86_64.dylib /usr/local/lib/libkoko_keywords.dylib
chmod 755 /usr/local/lib/libkoko_keywords.dylib
```

On Linux you can put the file anywhere as you also need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
mv libkoko_keywords_x86_64.so /usr/local/lib/libkoko_keywords.so
chmod 755 /usr/local/lib/libkoko_keywords.dylib
export export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

### Install go module

Get the module

```
go get github.com/kokocares/keywords-client/clients/go/koko_keywords
```

## Usage

Set the `KOKO_KEYWORDS_AUTH` environment to the authentication string provided
by Koko. To get an api key, complete our [sign up form](https://r.kokocares.org/api_signup).

```
export KOKO_KEYWORDS_AUTH=username:password
```

Import the module

```
import (
  "github.com/kokocares/keywords-client/clients/go/koko_keywords"
)
```

Then use the `Match` function to check whether a query prompt matches a risky
keyword. The function returns a tuple of type `bool, error`. Error will be `nil`
and the boolean value will represent whether the query matched a keyword or not.

```go
matched, match_err := koko_keywords.Match(tt.query, "", "")

if match_err != nil {
  // Handle error, recommend to log and panic
}

// Do something with matched

```

There are two optional params, `filter` and `version`, set them to the empty
string if you are not using them.

### Filter
Filter the keyword based on the taxonomy using a colon delimited list of “dimension=value” filters. Omitting a dimension does not filter by that dimension e.g.

```go
koko_keywords.Match("sewerslide", "category=eating,parenting:confidence=1,2", "")
```

This matches "sewerslide" against eating eating and parenting, with a confidence of 1 and 2 and any intensity (as intensity was omitted).

### Version
Use this to pin to a specific version of the regex otherwise the endpoint returns the latest. e.g.

```go
koko_keywords.Match("sewerslide", "", "20220206")
```

We do not recommend setting this as we frequently update keywords for better matching performance. 

## Performance
The underlying library is written in Rust and cross-compiled to the four major CPU targets. Regexes are cached based on the cache expiration headers (currently set to an hour). This ensures very low latency and overhead (< 1μs/req).


## Error Handling
The `Match` function returns a tuple `result, error`. If the match has been
performed successfully the error will be returned `nil`, otherwise an error
message will be returned.

## Logging
Minimal log messages are logged to STDERR
