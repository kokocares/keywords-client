Koko Keyword Python Client
============

A python client  for the [Koko Keywords API](https://developers.kokocares.org). The client handles caching to ensure very low latency.


## Install

```
pip install koko_keywords
```

## Usage

Set the `KOKO_KEYWORDS_AUTH` environment to the authentication string provided
by Koko. To get an api key, complete our [sign up form](https://r.kokocares.org/api_signup).

```
export KOKO_KEYWORDS_AUTH=username:password
```

Import the library

```py
import koko_keywords
```

Then use the `match` function to check whether a query prompt matches a risky
keyword

```py
koko_keywords.match("sewerslide")
```

There is one optional param, `filter`. 

### Filter
Filter the keyword based on the taxonomy using a colon delimited list of “dimension=value” filters. Omitting a dimension does not filter by that dimension e.g.

```py
koko_keywords.match("sewerslide", "category=eating,parenting:confidence=1,2")
```

This matches "sewerslide" against eating eating and parenting, with a confidence of 1 and 2 and any intensity (as intensity was omitted).

## Performance
The underlying library is written in Rust and cross-compiled to the four major CPU targets. Regexes are cached based on the cache expiration headers (currently set to an hour). This ensures very low latency and overhead (< 1μs/req).


## Error Handling
A RuntimeError will be raised with hints on how to resolve the issue. No exception handling should be necessary.

## Logging
Minimal log messages are logged to STDERR
