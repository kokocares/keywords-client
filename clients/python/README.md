Koko Keyword Client
============

A multi platform, native client with bindings (soon) to all major languages for
the [Koko Keywords
API](https://r.kokocares.org/koko_keywords/docs). The client handles caching to ensure very low latency.

## Install

```
pip install koko_keywords
```

## Usage

Set the `KOKO_KEYWORDS_AUTH` environment to the authentication string provided
by Koko (contact us at api@kokocares.org if you would like one).

```
export KOKO_KEYWORDS_AUTH=username:password
```

Import the library

```py
import koko_keywords
```

Then use the `match` function to check whether a query prompt matches a risky
keyword

```py
koko_keywords.match("sewerslide")
```

There are two optional params, `filter` and `version`. 

### Filter
Filter the keyword based on the taxonomy using a colon delimited list of “dimension=value” filters. Omitting a dimension does not filter by that dimension e.g.

```py
koko_keywords.match("sewerslide", "category=eating,parenting:confidence=1,2")
```

This matches "sewerslide" against eating eating and parenting, with a confidence of 1 and 2 and any intensity (as intensity was omitted).

### Version
Use this to pin to a specific version of the regex otherwise the endpoint returns the latest. e.g.

```py
koko_keywords.match("sewerslide", version="20220206")
```

## Performance
The underlying library is written in Rust and cross-compiled to the four major CPU targets. Regexes are cached based on the cache expiration headers (currently set to an hour). This ensures very low latency and overhead (~10ms/req).


## Error Handling
A RuntimeError will be raised with hints on how to resolve the issue. No exception handling should be necessary.

## Logging
Minimal log messages are logged to STDERR
